Scientific Calculator Walkthrough
I have successfully built a modern Scientific Calculator web application using React and Tailwind CSS.

Features
Scientific Functions: Trigonometry (sin, cos, tan), Logarithms (log, ln), Powers (^), and Roots (√).
History: Keeps track of your last 10 calculations.
Modern UI: Glassmorphism design with a dynamic background.
Responsive: Works on desktop and mobile.

How to Run
Open the terminal in the scientific-calculator directory.
Run npm run dev.
Open the local URL (usually http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

Verification Results
Arithmetic: Tested basic operations (+, -, *, /).
Scientific: Verified functions like 
sin(90 deg)
 and log(100).
UI: Confirmed the layout is responsive and the glassmorphism effect is applied.
